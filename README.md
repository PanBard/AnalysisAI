AnalysisAI is a one-page application that helps you in chemical analysis and allows you to better manage laboratory. 
It uses custom image detection and image classification algorithms to distinguish chemical analysis results.
The main functionality is a voice assistant that will guide through the stages of chemical analysis.
Also automate the comparison of pH test results obtained with test strips.
The login system supports face recognition, so you can log in to the site only by scanning your face.

The image recognition models are run on the client side in TensorFlow.js.
